![Video_2025-02-01_00-56-11-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa4b4dfc-2bac-4203-b319-7832d52307b6)

THIS MOD REQUIRES [EZ Text Replacer API](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/) TO WORK.

Thanks to [Nerrel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nerrel) for the textures for the HUD!

Note for speedrunners: Pressing B-mid dab will allow you to perform other actions afterwards, which allows you to still perform a blast mask hover.

### Features:
- DAB ON THEM HATERS by using the Blast Mask

- EPIC SUNGLASSES that replace the Blast Mask's model

### Notes:
- Link is invulnerable while dabbing (the explosion won't damage him). This is intentional.
