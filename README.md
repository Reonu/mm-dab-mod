### Features:
- DAB ON THEM HATERS by using the Blast Mask
- EPIC SUNGLASSES that replace the Blast Mask's model
- Thanks to [Nerrel](https://www.youtube.com/c/nerrel) for the textures for the HUD!

### Notes:
- You can only dab while standing still
- Link is invulnerable while dabbing (the explosion won't damage him)

### Building
- First, you need to build [N64Recomp](https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp) for the RecompModTool utility.
* Next, run `make` (with an optional job count) to build the mod code itself.
* Finally, run the `RecompModTool` utility with `mod.toml` as the first argument and the build dir (`build`) as the second argument.
  * This will produce your mod's `.nrm` file in the build folder.
